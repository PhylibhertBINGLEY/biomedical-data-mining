# Biomedical Data Mining
**Project Goal**: Identify groups of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns within an RNA sequence of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (a species of yeast). These groups often indicate that the genes may share similar biological functions.


How to run my program (python program): 

- Step1: Place the following files at the root of the same directory: my 'main.py' file ; the dataset 'E-MTAB-8626_tpms.tsv' ; the folder called 'genes_sequences' that I provided. 

- Step2: Make sure to be in the root of the working directory. 

- Step3: Then, you just have to write the following command and my program for all parts of the homework will run: 'python main.py' (python, python3, py depending on your python version environnement). 

- Alternative with Pycharm:
	- Create a project on Pycharm; 
	- Put my 'main.py' file + the dataset 'E-MTAB-8626_tpms.tsv' + the folder called 'genes_sequences' - that I provided - at the root 	of the project you created. 
	- Run the file 'main.py'.
